This program is to calculate performances of rocket engines.
I take no responsibility for any damage that is made by this if you use this program.

g :    gravity acceleration[m/s^2]
R :    universal gas constant[J/mol*K]
pa     :	atomospheric pressure[Pa]
ita    :	propulsive efficiency
gamma  :	ratio of specific heat
fis    :	structure mass ratio of refer
rhos   :	dencity of refer
To     :	temperature of atomosphere
ml     :	mass of payload
dv     :	delta v
aci    :	acceleration at initial
ts     :	duration in conbustion chamber
i(1)   :	propellant
i(2)   :	oxygen
o(fini)		:	exhaust gas
fini		:	number of exhaust gas
rho?()		:	dencity of ?()
M?()		:	mass number of ?()
h?()		:	hentalpy of ?()
c?()		:	coefficient in the chemical equation
ar		:	ration of combustion chamber and throat
po		:	pressure of combustion chamber
dtank		:	diameter of tank

ans = payload ratio,
      pressure of combustion chamber,
      mixture ratio
      temperature in combustion chamber
      specific thrust
      diameter of combustion chamber
      length of combustion chamber
      diameter of tank
      length of tank
